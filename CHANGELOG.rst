- ``Dash0Distro`` and ``Dash0Configurator`` providing zero-code instrumentation,
  pure-Python OTLP/HTTP export by default, an enable/disable gate, a Kubernetes
  pod-UID resource detector, a service-name fallback, a ``telemetry.distro.name``
  marker, an optional startup span, and graceful flush on ``SIGTERM``/``SIGINT``.
- Vendored pure-Python (pyproto) OTLP exporter packages as workspace members.
- ``examples/dash0-distro-flask`` end-to-end demo (local collector and Dash0
  ingress).

  example workflow.
- Release workflow (PyPI Trusted Publishing), pending the decisions in
  ``RELEASING.rst``.
